# Laravel + Next.js Pokemon List

## Get Started

1. Clone this repository on your computer
2. Navigate to the project's root directory and run the following command to set up your development environment:
```
ddev setup
```
This command will set up your development environment by installing all required Composer dependencies, generating a key for your application, executing Laravel migrations to create the database, importing Pokémon data, as well as installing NPM dependencies and running npm run build and npm run dev for your frontend.
## Usage

Once you've set up the project, you can access the frontend (FE) in your web browser at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

**Note**: After running `ddev setup`, if you stop the script and want to run `npm run build` and `npm run dev` again, make sure to be in the `frontend` directory to execute these commands. You can navigate to the `frontend` directory using the following command:
```
cd frontend
```
Then, you can run `npm run build` and `npm run dev`.
